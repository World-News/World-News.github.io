**Evaluation**

This week, we wrote evaluation plan based on proposed hypothesis. Our hypothesis contains three main questoins:
1. Whether different news (such as has different published date) has different matching accuracy. 
2. Whether translated news has the same frequency of being provided in the related news list as English news. 
3. Find a method to analyse the feedbacks and results of evaluation.

Based on this hypothesis, we consider next steps: evaluation subjects, data collection, data analysis... The detailed content about 
evaluation has been writted in our evaluation report.


**Update new match methods**

This week, we decided to abandon former match method which was based on keywords after processing some experiments.

Former match strategy:
         1. Find keywords of news documents through applying TF-IDF
         2. Combine keywords from two news into one set
         3. Generate word frequency vectors
         4. Calculate similarity ratio of two news based on vectors.	

Latest match strategy:
          1.	Get tokens of two news through tokenizing raw news documents
          2.	Calculate TF-IDF score and generate vector for each news
          3.	calculate cosine similarity of these vectors

After changing basic match strategy, we began to add new match tips to improve match accuracy. 

Add name entities match to latest match. 
We filter the news content to find name entities, human names, corporation names and names of organizations. When calculating similarity of two news, we need to calculating similarity of name entities from every news. The procedures are as followed:
          1.	Filter name entities of each news
          2.	build a set contains filtered names from two news 
          3.	Generate word frequency vectors based on name set
          4.	Calculate similarity of name entities

We need to find a balance between TF-IDF similarities and name entities similarities and distribute weight for each kind of similarity. 
We apply 1:1 as initial weight.
