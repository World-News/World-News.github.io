## Idea ##


Nowadays, people’s lifestyles are influenced by globalization. People not only concern themselves with local news, but also focus on the international news. And specially, in some modules like politics and sports, it’s interesting to know the opinions from different countries. However, there may be a language problem for readers to get information from other opinions written in different languages. Our app will focus on this problem and provides multiple views for users.
