This blog is about the outline of our project, and some initial pages designs. 

### Project Realization  ###


First of all, use python in server to collect rss news feeds from certain websites business part, such as BBC business, China Daily business regularly (maybe once an hour), store every collected feed into postgreSQL database, but just show English news in our main page. Then we translate our English news into Chinese, find corresponding Chinese feeds for each English feed in database depending on the content of English news through analysing & filter procedure and store them.
After collecting news for many times to make sure we already have enough information from different languages, we can start server to let users use app. A user can read any English business news in our app, if he is interested in what are Chinese’ views on it he can click ‘search’ button, then our server will receive the request and get corresponding Chinese news from database based on his request to show him.


###  Project Development ###

**Front-end**

Apply our functions on our 'Financial Eye' Android application, show the financial news we collected and filted. There is a list of 3 or 5 news items translated from Chinese whose source are China for every user chosen news. 

**Back-end**
 
 Mainly functionalities for the back-end in 'Finanacial Eye'. First we need to collect the news from different data sources. This work will be done by analyzing different html or xml website structures and run the fetching method at some interval to refresh the data. Another function is to analyze the collected news and evaluate the similarities to find the different views on the same story with the help of other methods. At the moment, we consider that the similarity of two articles, the publish date of those articles and the user feedback can be used to organized them for front- end displaying.
